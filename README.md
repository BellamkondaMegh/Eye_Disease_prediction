# Eye_Disease_prediction
Eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, Age-related disease called as macular
degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, Hypertension, normal, Pathological Myopia are major
causes of vision loss and blindness. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, but
traditional diagnostic methods can be slow and limited in access. This project aims to
develop a deep learning model for the multi-level classification of fundus images using
the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) database. By applying data
augmentation techniques to address data imbalance and employing the convolutional
neural network using a transfer learning, VGG 16, ResNet50 this study seeks to improve
the accuracy and efficiency of eye disease detection, ultimately enhancing patient care
